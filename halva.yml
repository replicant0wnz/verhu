  description: |
    'Your earliest memories are of following an army in eastern Wästland.
    You have thirty or so friends who never let you down: YOUR TEETH. Disloyal, deranged or simply uncontrollable, any group that didn’t boot you out you left anyway. But your parliament of teeth — enormous, protruding, thick and sharp — have always been your allies.
    Unhelpful and Conflicted. Staring, manic gaze. Obsessively collects small sharp stones.'
